<b><h1><p>Explore Brazil</p></h1></b>

<h3><p>Brazil is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest nation in the world. It forms an enormous triangle on the eastern side of the continent with a 7,400km coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. It has borders with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador. The Brazilian landscape is very varied. It is most well known for its dense forests, including the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest, in the north. But there are also dry grasslands (called pampas), rugged hills, pine forests, sprawling wetlands, immense plateaus (areas of level high ground) and a long coastal plain.</h3></p>

<p>São Miguel das Missões was a reduction (village) founded in the 18th century by the Jesuits or the ‘Society of Jesus’ and was intended as a place for the indigenous Guarani Indian population to live once they had converted to Christianity.Today, all that remains of the mission are its beautiful architectural ruins , including the Italian designed church. The site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984. There’s now also a small museum with 18th century artefacts found nearby displayed, which was established in the late 1930s. It remains an atmospheric site, and one of the best preserved missions in Brazil. Go with a full camera battery to make the most of the spectacular scenery.

<p>Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor) is a 30 metre high statue, mounted upon an 8 metre pedestal, and of course the 700 metre high mountain of Corcovado. It was constructed between 1922 and 1931 from soapstone and reinforced concrete. Today it is a Brazilian cultural icon and global symbol of Christianity.

An earlier proposal for a Christian monument on Mount Corcovada was dismissed after the country became a republic in 1889, when the roles of church and state were separated. However a second proposal came in 1920 from Catholics motivated by the perceived atheism of contemporary Rio de Janeiro.

The proposal attracted donations to support the construction, which came largely from Brazilian Catholics. Designs included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus holding a globe in his hands and a pedestal that symbolised the world. The resultant Christ the Redeemer statue symbolises peace.

Christ the Redeemer was created by French sculptor Paul Landwoski and Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, working with French engineer Albert Caquot. It weighs 635 metric tons. The face of the Christ the Redeemer statue was created by Gheorghe Leonida, a Romanian sculptor living in Paris hired by Landowski.

On the 75th anniversary of the statue’s construction, in October 2006, the Archbishop of Rio consecrated a chapel beneath the statue. The statue was hit by lightning in 2008 and in 2014, causing damage, while it has also been the focus of recent renovation efforts.

<b><h1><p>Transport<p></h1></b>
<br>
   <p><b>Bus: </b>Buses are by far the most common and flexible form of public transport in Brazil. All major cities have a public bus system, as well as a bus station that provides options for travelling to other cities. Cost and safety will vary based on location. but city bus fares are usually inexpensive. Travelling between cities can be more expensive, but buses are reliable and cost less than flying – although, due to the size of Brazil, it's not always practical to cross the country by bus.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <p><b>Metro: </b>Brazil has metro systems in a handful of cities, but their usefulness varies. In Rio de Janeiro, the metro is clean and safe. In São Paulo, the metro can be a good option, but tends to be extremely crowded. Smaller cities are making improvements over time which should make the metro a more useful option for residents and visitors in future.</p> 	
<br>
<br>
    <p><b>Boats: </b>Boats provide services to get to islands along Brazil’s extensive coastline and various locations along the country’s many rivers. In some places, especially in the Amazon region, boats may offer the only available transportation. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><h1><p>Weather<p></h1></b>
<br><p>The tropical and subtropical climate makes Brazil an all-year round destination. The Brazilian winter lasts for only three months from June to August. From December to February it's summer and most rain is seen in these months. Most parts of Brazil have moderate annual rainfall of between 900 and 1600 mm (38 and 61 in). The temperature varies within a year with monthly averages in winter between 13 and 18 degrees Celsius (55 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit). During summer temperatures can reach 30 to 40 degrees Celsius (86 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Rio de Janeiro and in regions in the south, this accompanied by frequent showers creates a rather heavy humidity. Even though Brazil is an all-year round destination we choose June to September as the best time to travel to Brazil. In most of the country this is the period when there is less precipitation, the temperatures are somewhat tempered and the travel conditions are at its best.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><h1><p>Languages</p></h1></b>
<br><p>Though Spanish is the primary language in most South American countries, Portuguese is actually what’s spoken most in South America, and that’s all thanks to Brazil. In the country of Carnaval, Samba and Bossa Nova, Portuguese is more or less spoken by everybody, but there’s still plenty of room for the coexistence of languages like Japanese, Spanish, Dutch and Vlax Romani, to say nothing of the 274 indigenous languages ​spoken by individuals belonging to 305 different ethnicities, according to 2010 Census estimates. Brazil is one of the most biodiverse places in the world, and it’s also home to a stunning amount of cultural and linguistic diversity. But just as its biological riches are mostly hidden in the deep folds of the Amazonian rainforest, its linguistic variance is similarly concentrated in its most remote reaches.</p>
