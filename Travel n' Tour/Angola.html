The structure has a mysterious history because there is no record of its existence but,it is believed to have been pre-built in France during the 1890s and was heading for Madagascar by boat but was instead drifted by 
the harsh Benguela currents and ended up in Angola's Skeleton Coast where it was later claimed by the Portuguese,and was made into an art center.
The palace was neglected after Angola gained independence and then was heavily damaged during the countrys' civil war.
