<p>Valley of the Kings</p>
The Valley of Kings also known as The Valley of the Gates of the Kings,is a valley in Egypt located on the west bank of the Nile,opposite Thebas,within the heart of the Theban Necropolis.
For almost 500 years during the 16th to 11th century BC,tombs were cut out of the rock and excavated for pharaohs and powerful nobles of the time.
It consists of two valleys :The East Valley and The West Valley.The royal tombs are decorated with scenes and images from Egyptian mythology and gives insight into the beliefs,funeral and burial practices of the time.
With the 2005 discovery of a new chamber added by the further discovery of two further tomb entrances,
the valley continues to stimulate interest and research worldwide.</p>
