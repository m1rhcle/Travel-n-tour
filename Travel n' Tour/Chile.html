<h3><p>Chile, country situated along the western seaboard of South America. It extends approximately 2,700 miles (4,300 km) from its boundary with Peru, at latitude 17°30′ S, to the tip of South America at Cape Horn, latitude 56° S, a point only about 400 miles north of Antarctica. A long, narrow country, it has an average width of only about 110 miles, with a maximum of 217 miles at the latitude of Antofagasta and a minimum of 9.6 miles near Puerto Natales. It is bounded on the north by Peru and Bolivia, on its long eastern border by Argentina, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. Chile exercises sovereignty over Easter Island, the Juan Fernández Archipelago, and the volcanic islets of Sala y Gómez, San Félix, and San Ambrosio, all of which are located in the South Pacific. Chile also claims a 200-mile offshore limit. The capital is Santiago.</h3></p>

<p>‘Discovered’ by Dutch explorers in 1722, Easter Island – so named because the explorers landed on Easter Sunday – is thought to have been inhabited since 700AD and perhaps even as early as the fourth century AD. This is still disputed, as is the origin of the people of Easter Island. Most scientists now believe that the first inhabitants were of Polynesian descent. Perhaps the most famous aspects of Easter Island are its almost 900 head shaped statues, known as moai. Originally known as the “living faces of our ancestors”, the moai are incredibly large and heavy stone statues which are thought to have been built in around 1000AD to protect the islanders. When they were found, the moai were not standing and a large number have since been erected upright. Much of the reason behind the mystery of Easter Island is due to the vast reduction in its population over the years. When found, Easter Island had around 12,000 inhabitants, but by the late 19th century, this had diminished to around 110 people, through a combination of emigration, the arrival of new European diseases, and slavers raiding the island repeatedly. In 1888, Chile annexed Easter Island. Today, the population has recovered significantly, returning to between 7000 and 8000 inhabitants at any one time .

<p>The Pre-Columbian archaeological site of Pukará de Quitor is a stone fortress in Chile’s Atacama Desert. Situated close to the desert town of San Pedro de Atacama, the ruins date to perhaps the 12th century AD. The walled city was ruled by the Inca until the 16th century, when the Spanish struggled for two decades to subdue its inhabitants.

The ancient city itself was protected by fortifications now preserved as an archaeological site. Pukará de Quitor was declared a national monument of Chile in 1982. A ticket must be purchased to visit the site.

<b><h1><p>Transport<p></h1></b>
<br>
   <p><b>Bus: </b>Buses are the most common way of getting around Chile. Within the cities, buses travel regularly along fixed routes, and give you a quick and inexpensive way to get around. A typical bus journey is around 300 Chilean pesos. For long-distance trips, buses are the most popular way to go. Services run between just about every major city throughout Chile, as well as other South American countries. Since many of these bus trips can be 24 hours or more (Santiago to Punta Arenas takes about 40 hours, with one change-over), comfortable reclining seats and sleeper buses are available.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <p><b>Metro: </b>Santiago, Chile’s largest city, has a fast and modern metro system. While this is a convenient way to get around the city, it is somewhat expensive compared to busses.  A single trip ticket costs between 520 and 620 Chilean Pesos, depending on whether you are traveling during peak times or off-peak times.</p> 	
<br>
<br>
    <p><b>Train: </b>Because of Chile’s mountainous terrain, trains aren’t a particularly important or efficient means of transport. Although there are trains connecting a few cities, they often take longer than buses, offer a similar level of comfort, and are more expensive.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><h1><p>Weather<p></h1></b>
<br><p>he climate of Chile comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large geographic scale, extending across 38 degrees in latitude, making generalizations difficult. According to the Köppen system, Chile within its borders hosts at least seven major climatic subtypes, ranging from low desert in the north, to alpine tundra and glaciers in the east and southeast, tropical rainforest in Easter Island, Oceanic in the south and Mediterranean climate in central Chile. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><h1><p>Languages</p></h1></b>
<br><p>The official language of Chile is Spanish. The accent of the Chileans is similar to the Latin Americans at the primary stage. They speak Spanish in their own way, style and mannerisms while talking. Despite the fact that the language has comparison with standard Spanish, yet their unique grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, and manner of conversation is notable homogeneous. Southern Chile is improved with German tradition and spoken all over the country by 35,000 speakers. Therefore a small group of citizens speak German. Chileans also converse in some of the indigenous languages like Aymara and Mapudungun (language used by natives who lived in the areas of Itata and Tolten Rivers). Some native languages of the country that are currently extinct include Selknam, Kunza, Kakauhua and Diaguita.</p>
