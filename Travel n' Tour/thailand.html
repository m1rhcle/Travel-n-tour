<p id="p2"><br>Discover Thailand, the Kingdom in Southeast Asia. The country is bordered in west and northwest by Myanmar (Burma), in south west by the Andaman Sea, in east and north east by Lao PDR, in south east by Cambodia, in south by the Gulf of Thailand (an inlet of the South China Sea), and by Malaysia. In south the country occupies a part of the Malay Peninsula. </br>


<br>Known for its coastal beaches, offshore islands, ancient ruins, temples, rainforests, and unique cultures, Thailand has a thriving tourism industry. There is no doubt that most visitors are not disappointed. Most visitors enter Thailand through its capital, Bangkok and travel from here to the beaches or jungle towns in the south or north. </br></p>

<h1 id="header1"> Wat Rong Khun</h1>	 
<p id="p3"> The White Temple, more commonly known as Wat Rong Khun, is one of the most well-known temples in Thailand. There are many visitors to the temple outside Chiang Rai, both Thai and foreign, making it one of the province's most popular attractions. About 15 kilometers south-west of Chiang Rai town, it is located just off Highway 1 (Phahonyothin road). Wat Rong Khun differs from other temples with its white color and pieces of glass embedded in the plaster, which sparkle in the sun. Glass holds the meaning of wisdom and Dhamma, the teachings of the Buddha, while white symbolizes the Buddha's purity and purity.

<h1 id="header2"> The Grand Palace </h1>	 
<p id="p4"> The Grand Palace in Bangkok is a grand old dame indeed, which continues to mesmerize visitors with its beautiful architecture and intricate detail, all of which is a testament to Thailand's creativity and craftsmanship. This palace complex encompasses several impressive buildings, including the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew). The temple houses the small but famous Emerald Buddha, which dates back to the 14th century. The complex continues to be the spiritual center of Thailand. </p>

<h1 id="header3">  Khao Phing Kan</h1>	 
<p id="p5"> Ko Khao Phing Kan (also known as Khao Phing Kan and, less formally, "James Bond Island"), is part of Ao Phang Nga National Park in Phang Nga Bay. Khao Phing Kan was originally composed of two parts, including Khao Phing Kan, a compound of limestone karst towers. The island itself features lush vegetation, turquoise water, and hidden ocean caves, making it one of Thailand's best-known destinations. In addition to visiting the seashore and exploring the city, you can also take part in many fascinating activities. Explore James Bond Island's glorious caves that have existed for thousands of years as well as get a chance to explore many interesting things that Mother Nature blessed the island with, or simply relax and gain some space from the hectic pace of the metropolitan life. </p>



<h1 id="header4"> Transport</h1>
<p id="p6"> 
<br><b>Tuk Tuks:</b> In Southeast Asia, you've probably seen many pictures of Tuk Tuks, the native mode of transportation in Thailand. There is no doubt that you should at least take a ride on a Tuk Tuk. It is a very unique experience you won't find at home.
</br><br><b>Bangkok BTS Skytrain:</b>A BTS Skytrain consists of the Sukhumvit Line and the Silom Line, two overground railway lines in Bangkok. Overground railways in Bangkok serve many tourist sites and attractions and are very developed in comparison to large Western cities, making it easy to get around the city. </br><br><b>MRT Subway:</b> Known as the Blue Line, the MRT Subway is the first underground rail line in Bangkok's rail network. In addition to encompassing 18 stops, it follows a slightly different route to the BTS Skytrain, enabling travellers to commute via train to areas normally inaccessible by the Skytrain. Travelers from both BTS and MRT can access their desired destinations with greater flexibility due to the intersections of both lines. BTS and MRT networks both operate Monday through Friday from 6 am to midnight. </br> </p>

<h1 id="header5"> Weather</h1>
<p id="p7"> <br>Majority of the country experiences a sub-tropical climate leading to hot and humid conditions throughout the year. The seasons vary in different parts of Thailand, the northern and southern part. In the northern part, there's usually three seasons: Summer (March-June), Monsoon (July-October) and Winter (November-February). Summers consist of little precipitation and lots of humidity, temperatures reaching 40 degrees celcius. Monsoon season brings lots of relief rain throughout with sunny spells and frequent thunderstorms. Flooding is very common as a result of this in flat areas like the Central region which also includes Bangkok. Winters in Thailand give the residents a break from the heat as it cools off. With humidity dropping and temperatures remaining at 30- 35 degrees celcius, the country is blessed with a breezy season. </br></p>


<h1 id="header6"> Languages</h1>
<p id="p8">Around 88 percent of the country's 69 million residents speak Thai as their only official language. In Thailand, only 34 percent of people speak Thai as their native language. Thailand's "official" version of Thai is based on a dialect native to the Bangkok region, and the language is part of the larger Tai language family. 


<br>Additionally, there are Yawis (a Malay dialect), Teochew speakers (rooted in Old Chinese), and Lao speakers in Thailand. </br>
