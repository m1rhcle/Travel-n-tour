<p id="p2"><br>This Middle Eastern country has a history that spans 10,000 years. It has a surprisingly diverse landscape, considering how small it is. With its World Heritage Sites, friendly towns and breath-taking landscapes, Jordan has delighted tourists for centuries. Despite its northern border not quite reaching the Mediterranean, the Ajloun Forest Reserve enjoys cool breezes which blow through the trees. But the north is a world away from the rocky shores of Wadi Rum or the salty shores of the Dead Sea to the south. While Amman, the capital and only coastal city of Jordan, is all about keeping busy, Aqaba, the country's only coastal city, is all about relaxing.  </br></p>

<h1 id="header1"> Dead Sea</h1>	 
<p id="p3"> The Dead Sea is an excellent holiday destination, and Jordan is the ideal setting for people looking for peace and quiet while enjoying the benefits of the lake. The Dead Sea is officially the lowest place on earth, making it even more captivating. The Dead Sea is 423 meters below sea level. The Dead Sea, also called the Salt Sea, is a popular destination for rest and relaxation with plenty of hiking and biking opportunities. Taking a holiday to the Dead Sea offers an idyllic alternative to the busy cities, with a wide range of activities for the adventurous traveler. In addition to offering biking and hiking opportunities, the Dead Sea is also known as the Salt Sea. Those seeking a little adventure might enjoy a holiday in the Dead Sea as a relaxing alternative to the bustling cities. With snorkeling, diving, and bathing activities available, holidays at the Dead Sea are very popular, both among locals and tourists. </p>

<h1 id="header2"> Petra </h1>	 
<p id="p4"> Jordan's southwestern desert is home to the famous archaeological site of Petra. The site dates back to the 300s BC. Petra, the "rose red city", the city 'half as old as time', one of the 'Seven Wonders of the World', was carved out of the rocky southern Jordanian desert by the Nabateans over 2000 years ago . What was then the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom, was lost for 2000 years until it was rediscovered 200 years ago by a Swedish explorer. Over the past 200 years, more and more of Petra has been uncovered, and more treasures are still being uncovered to this day.  </p>

<h1 id="header3"> Wadi Rum</h1>	 
<p id="p5"> In the far southern part of Jordan, east of the Rift Valley, lies Wadi Rum. The city is situated about 60km (35mi) northeast of Aqaba, 100km (60mi) south of Petra and 300km (185mi) south of Amman. A magnificent landscape and environment which resembles Mars, despite being on Earth, is created by the blood-red sands and the unworldly sandstone mountains. As a result of its red-dish sand and red mountains, Wadi Rum is a favorite setting for films featuring Mars. </p>



<h1 id="header4"> Transport</h1>
<p id="p6"> 
<br><b>Train:</b> A few train excursions are organized by international tour companies on the Hejaz Railway occasionally, but there are no trains in Jordan. This train barely runs and is an extremely luxury form of public transport. 
</br><br><b>Minibus:</b>Minibuses do not function on a timetable and instead leave when they are packed; they also run very infrequently or not at all on Fridays and public holidays. To get to a specific location, you will need to go to the next large town and ask around for information on where to catch a bus that will take you to your desired location. </br><br><b>JETT Buses:</b> These buses operate on a set timetable and could be reserved in advance to ensure a seating which is highly recommended. They are typically more costly than traditional buses, but they're more luxurious, non-smoking, and provide wi-fi access on occasion. </br> </p>

<h1 id="header5"> Weather</h1>
<p id="p7"> <br>In the spring and autumn, Jordan is at its best, when temperatures reach the high twenties during the day and are cooler at night. The climate is pleasant and ideal for exploring - it isn't too hot for hiking in nature reserves, and both fauna and flora are abundant. </br>
<br>During Jordan's summer months, temperatures are often in the forties. If you are not adversely affected by heat, it is still worthwhile to consider a trip during this time as you will have sites like Petra almost to yourself. </br>
<br>The desert regions of Jordan experience cold nights and snow in the winter months. The majority of rain also falls during the winter, but showers tend to be short and sharp. </br></p>

<h1 id="header6"> Languages</h1>
<p id="p8"><b>Arabic:</b>

Officially, Arabic is the language of Jordan. Nearly all of the country's population, including minority communities, speaks Arabic. Media and documents are commonly written in Arabic. As a junction between Arabia and the Middle East, Jordan has a wide range of Arabic dialects. In Jordan, three varieties of Arabic are spoken: urban Arabic, rural Arabic, and Bedouin Arabic.  

<br><b>English: </b>

As a British colony, English has been the primary foreign language in the country since 1946. Among the languages taught in the country, it is taught alongside Arabic. Secondary schools teach it as a compulsory subject. The Jordanian job market requires an understanding of English, so universities and institutions of higher learning have also prioritized its study. Media, business, and scientific studies are all fields where English now competes with Arabic. </br></p>
